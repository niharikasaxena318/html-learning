          <p>
            I was a Dot Net FSD till (2010-2016), In 2016, I switched into
            Frontend and started working as an Angular developer and an in-house
            trainer for my team. But just after a few days, I came to know that
            I am going to be the MOM of my cute kid, and I needed to take a
            break from my career. I took a maternity break of 3 years from May
            2018 to 2021. Then now I have gradually started again and now I am
            working as a freelance developer.

            COVID teaches all of us that health is a true friend, I also realize
            it and learn yoga therapy as an alternative treatment for common
            diseases. Now I am working as a yoga instructor, a therapist, and an
            angular 6+ front End Engineer as a self-employed person.

            I was an Angular Developer in my last role and I continue the same

            my job and started doing my own freelance work to maintain my family
            life as well. I worked as a front-end Engineer (Angular) during this
            duration. Maximum projects I managed with the help of my team and my
            part is client communication, team handling, task distribution and
            sometimes I develop also. I learn yoga and therapy in covid duration
            (2021 - 22) because I truly feel health is wealth.
